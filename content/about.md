{{< figure src="/img/avatar.jpg" alt="Edward Seymour" class="right-aligned" >}}

I'm a senior at The University of Texas at El Paso studying Computer Science.
I'm an undergraduate research assistant at the Robust Autonomic Systems and a
teaching assistant for CS4316/5313 Computer Networks.

I'm also software engineer at [Freudensong LLC] developing the Freudensong
app for Android and its underlying cross-platform DSP library used by
iOS, Android and Universal Windows Platform applications.

My development interests are in natural language processing, deep learning, and
reinforcement learning.
